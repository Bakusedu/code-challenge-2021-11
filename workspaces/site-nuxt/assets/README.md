# User Interface

- [x] The unique content of the page template (the main element) can be seen and interacted with as a Storybook story. We've started this for you as Software Page > [see empty story](https://nostalgic-colden-eec37e.netlify.app/?path=/story/base-input-button--button)
- [x] Do not include the header and footer. Only the unique content of the software page template should be included in your Storybook story.
- [x] The UI exactly matches the designs in the Figma file.
- [x] All content can be changed by passing data to Vue props (no content is hard coded in the HTML). The page is seeded with sample content.
- [x] The layout looks good at all (reasonable) viewports and flows smoothly through breakpoints.
