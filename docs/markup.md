# Semantic Markup & A11y Concerns
We want to create the most accessible markup possible for our clients, as such we should be using the most relevant
[HTML5 elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) avoiding divs and spans when there are
more semantic elements that will fit the bill. However, semantic markup is only half the battle and accessibility
extends also into usage by users accessing the site with assistive technologies or even more basic things like
keyboard-only navigation.

## References, Tools, and Resources
There is a built in A11y tool in Storybook to test whether your Vue components and markup are accessible, but you should
also run other tests on your code to ensure A11y compliance. The following is a listing of tools, references, and resource
that we have found to be useful:
